It might be that you've just discovered you are part of the LGBTQIA+ rainbow. You may have decided to make the first steps of transitioning.  You and your partner could be thinking about adding to your family via adoption. In any case, you are making the conscious decision to live your truth. That is a beautiful and empowering thing.",
            'p2': "That doesn't mean it won't be scary. The Fool card is all about taking leaps of faith. It's hard to see what is waiting at the end of the road when you are just starting on your journey. But it will be so much harder for you in the long run if you turn your back on what your heart has been telling you all along. Take a deep breath. Then, take that first step. You can do this."

It's like you've become a beacon, bringing in what you need to express yourself authentically and fully. What you need will appear when you need it.",
            'p2': "There's also a bit of “fake it ‘til you make it” energy in this card. Let's be honest. There are a lot of folx in our community that are extra disadvantaged because of financial and additional societal constraints. Still, within you lies the ability to make the most of what you have and turn it into something greater than its parts. Maybe you've been wondering if you have what it takes to pull off a transformation as a fabulous drag queen, a gender affirming transition, or simply just living out and proud. The Magician energy says yes you do. A little glitter can cover over any rough edges while you are finding your feet. The most important thing is that you step out and express yourself authentically."

So many people on the LGBTQIA+ spectrum have had their needs and wants invalidated by the outside world. It's hard to separate intuition from anxiety because of the spiritual toll that takes. But the energy of the High Priestess is here to give you a gentle affirmation to trust yourself and your intuition. Your inner wisdom is waiting to be heard.",
            'p2': "When the High Priestess comes up, it can also be letting you know that you have the breathing room to do some self-evaluation and find out who you are without a societal script forced on you. There's so much pressure to conform or settle, especially when personal safety becomes an issue. But now there is time and energy available to be honest with yourself about your desires, and discover what feels best for you, emotionally and physically. Be fearless in exploring who you are."

The energy is there for you to fully manifest anything that's been gestating inside of you.",
            'p2': "Mentoring others also is part of the Empress. You may find some of your harder edges softening as you help guide others through a place you've been before. You might see yourself in someone who is just beginning to question the concept of gender. The newbie at your regular LGBTQIA+ hangout might be asking for help coming out to other people. Understand that you both have the wisdom and compassion needed to help fellow members of the community. Just make sure that helping doesn't become taking over the agency of another person."

Admittedly, society's hard patriarchal rules can make ideas like restraint and control seem oppressive. But think of it less as control for the sake of conforming to societal norms and more as taking back control for yourself and in your own self-interest. You get to define what rules make sense for you and help you thrive. Establishing healthy boundaries are part of the Emperor's energy. You are the Monarch/ Queen/ King of your life, and you make the rules deciding who gets to be part of your realm.",
            'p2': "There's also a self-love aspect associated with the Emperor, but it's the sort of self-love you demonstrate when you hold yourself accountable to your own goals and dreams. The Emperor card is challenging you to think about what your part is in creating your own happiness and cultivating the discipline needed to get what you want. What area of your life could benefit from you committing more strongly to it? The Emperor's energy can help you most there."

After all, government, the legal system, the educational system, and organized religion don't always play fair. You may find that you may have to deal more frequently with one of these because of circumstances in your life. Understandably, you might be feeling a fair amount of stress with these interactions. Try to become as knowledgeable with the institution's norms and rules ahead of time. Or find someone savvier than you are to help you navigate your way through, as well as help you keep your sanity in the process.",
            'p2': "Also keep in mind, we are creating our own institutions to help protect and elevate our own beloved communities. You might find you have an opportunity to become a bigger part of that effort. Embrace it! Everyone has skills they can share that can improve the lives of others. Become more active in your local social justice projects. The Hierophant might also be a call to reclaim folkways that celebrate the LGBTQIA+ experience, if you are a member of a culture that has them. These are traditions worth rediscovering and passing down to the next LGBTQIA+ generation."

            'p1': "The most straightforward interpretation of this card indicates the arrival of love or of a new harmonious stage to your current love affair. But there is an older, more traditional meaning of this card which is all about choice. Ironically, the traditional meaning is the one that usually comes into play for people in the LGBTQIA+ community, especially if it's a choice involving what your heart wants versus what society expects. There are often extra decisions that need be made in our relationships, especially if one partner wants/ needs to stay in the closet and the other is happier being loud and proud. One of you may be more interested in exploring a kinky lifestyle than the other. You need to decide what aspects of your relationship are non-negotiable and what areas you can be more flexible with.",
            'p2': "The Lovers card could also mean it's time to assess what a healthy relationship situation feels like to you. It doesn't have to follow strict cis or heteronormative standards. If a polyamorous arrangement is most fulfilling to you, embrace it. If you know you would be most content in a monogamous relationship, then embrace that. Whether it's rebelling for rebellion's sake or conforming for conformity's sake, either way means giving up your agency if it doesn't come from a place of authenticity. Be true to your heart first and foremost."

So many of us in the LGBTQIA+ community have to consciously cultivate that drive in the face of a society that does its best to slow our momentum down. The battle for our rights, for equity under the law, for more societal equity in general (especially for those of us with intersectional identities) – the collectives that led the charge on that had to have energy akin to The Chariot's to make any headway. This card is letting you know that even if you are running into stumbling blocks or delays, now is not the time to be timid or slow down. Take the momentum from the decisions you've made before and use it to manifest your will.",
            'p2': "Since will and the ability to dominate a situation fall under the auspices of The Chariot, this card can also represent an interest in exploring BDSM, especially the domination side of it. There may be some trepidation in exploring that aspect of yourself because of all the bad information out there. If you've been curious about it, know that there is good information available on how to participate in safe and consensual ways. With knowledge and an understanding partner(s) you can fully release this aspect of yourself and enjoy it."

Kindness and compassion don't just strengthen the giver and the receiver, they have the power to strengthen and inspire our whole community. The application of radical kindness to the ones who need it most can shift paradigms. Don't forget to include yourself in that either. You are worthy of compassion and should not feel any guilt about enforcing your personal boundaries when disrespected. This includes bisexual people who are regularly invalidated as “just going through a phase”, transexual folks who are constantly dead named, and any of our LGBTQIA+ family who has their right to exist questioned. ",
            'p2': "The Strength card is also about endurance and patience. You might be going through something difficult right now and be wondering about your strength to get through it. The Strength card is a reminder that you have the ability to move past this. One of the biggest strengths of our community is to endure through hardships and continue to grow despite them. This card may also be especially relevant to any community organizers or activists because of this. Consider it a gentle nudge from the Universe to think about what the most loving way to show up for our community is at this point. Be compassionate, protect the vulnerable, and stand firm against anything that would do them harm."

This is the energy of the Hermit. It isn't unusual for this card to come up when we are going through (or just about to start) a period of second-guessing ourselves. We might find ourselves here after the end of our first queer relationship. We can also arrive at this place when an attempt to come out to our family and friends doesn't go the way we had hoped. Your identity is valid. Your feelings are valid. Time and space will give you the healing you need to remember who you are.",
            'p2': "The Hermit card can also signal the beginning of a period of abstaining from sex, whether you just went through a breakup or not. You might find some new things to appreciate about yourself. You may even find that you prefer life this way and start to investigate your position on the asexual/ aromantic spectrum. Whether this is merely a pause in your romantic life or a discovery of a new aspect of your identity, be gentle with yourself. The knowledge gained during this period will be helpful to you in the end."

Many times, those of us in the LGBTQIA+ community have had to make our own luck, but the energy of the Wheel of Fortune says the odds have just tilted in our direction or are about to. Maybe local media gives positive attention to a social justice cause you are passionate about, resulting in more support. Maybe your dream of bringing art that uplifts the LGBTQIA+ community gets better than hoped for support through crowd funding or attracts the attention of people with the additional resources to make your dream a reality. Whatever it is, keep your eyes open and move on it as quickly as possible. You need to be adaptable to take full advantage of it. The window of opportunity can close as quickly as it was opened.",
            'p2': "The adaptable aspect of the Wheel of Fortune's energy also resonates with the genderfluid and genderqueer members of our community.

Investigate if your truth is better expressed without them and allow yourself to adapt and flow with the turning of your own inner wheel."

The news is full of horrific stories of injustice towards the LGBTQIA+ community, especially those with intersectional identities. It isn't hard to come away with the feeling that justice is a privilege, and we are not the ones it was made to protect. Rather than a guarantee of justice, this card can be seen as more of a challenge: What can you do to make this a more just world? You don't have to make speeches or lead demonstrations if that isn't your thing. Everyone has something they can do, no matter how small to help a larger cause.",
            'p2': "The Justice card also speaks of personal integrity and living a life aligned with your core values. This is not always easy, especially if you are partially or completely in the closet. It can also be making you aware that relationships can become problematic if you are not honestly communicating your needs (emotional, physical, sexual, etc.) with your partner(s). There's always a risk that comes when you show your true self to others, but any relationship (romantic or platonic) worth having should be built on integrity."

What comes next for you will likely be uncomfortable no matter which choice you make. You may be faced with choices like advocating for equity for LGBTQIA+ folks in your workplace and derailing your career or putting up with daily microagressions from your coworkers but still being able to pay rent. Or perhaps your local school board has taken reactionary steps to erase the experiences and existence of marginalized Americans. Everyone who speaks out against this gets harassment and threats but staying quiet brings its own sort of misery. Endure the pain of the moment or make a sacrifice to avoid that pain – listen to your heart to know what the right decision is for you.",
            'p2': "The themes of endurance and sacrifice can also point to a fascination with BDSM, especially the submissive aspect of it. There may be some nervousness about exploring this side of yourself given the skewed way it is represented in mainstream society. This will also require being very secure with your partner(s) and having a high level of trust in them. But if you can establish that, you might find a lot of personal freedom in being able to allow yourself to submit to your desires."

Trans folx experience this when they stop using their dead name and take on a new one that suits their identity. Cutting ties with those who treat you disrespectfully marks the death of those relationships, but makes room for better, affirming ones. Leaving your homophobic hometown for good is another example of the way the Death card might manifest its energy.",
            'p2': "These definite and dramatic changes can feel very freeing, but it is also natural to grieve a little bit. It is hard to come to terms with the fact that some things are never going to happen, like unconditional love from a parent, or growing old in a place you once loved to live in. Give yourself time and space to mourn that. Surround yourself with people who understand the mixed feelings of sadness for what's left behind and excitement for your future. Death is just part of a cycle, with rebirth waiting for you on the other side."

Secondly, even within one individual, balance is often a moving target and what will get you centered in one moment can throw you off in another. LGBTQIA+ people are familiar with self-assessment, just by virtue of having analyzed their sexuality and/or gender to embrace who they are. Now it is time to look at your life and ask yourself honestly where your feel off balance. We often face a lot of pressure, especially if we have intersectional identities, to be exemplary and above reproach. But that constant pressure can leave us burned out and out of touch with our authentic selves.",
            'p2': "Curiosity and self-compassion are important in this journey, as well as ruthless honesty. One person might find activism work energizes them, while someone who already devotes a lot of time to activist work might need to find space to take a break from it to recharge their batteries. Getting out there and being social might be what one person needs while another finds what they need in solitude and quiet. You can't shortcut the work it takes to find what you need to become centered, nor can you put it off. You owe it to yourself to befriend yourself and give your spirit the self-care it needs."

The Devil card can shine a light on things individuals and society prefer to keep hidden. We know that the world is better now that our identities as LGBTQIA+ people are more openly discussed. What parts of us are we keeping forced in the shadows? Sometimes we really don't like what we find there – like internalized homophobia or internalized racism. Until we recognize those parts of ourselves, we can't free ourselves from their control.",

The Devil card can point to something that might be pulling our attention away from what we think we ought to be focusing on. Instead of trying to ignore it or shut those thoughts out, ask yourself why you are drawn to it. Is your fear based on what society has conditioned you to want or expect? Yes, this card could easily represent being drawn to kink. It can also represent adopting a more sex positive outlook in general. What if what you've been running from has the power to make you whole? We can grow a lot when we confront what we've been avoiding.

Even the most traditional interpretations of the Tower say that it crumbles so easily because it was built on a faulty or flawed foundation. There are a lot of modern institutions also built on flimsy assumptions! When people shout “Smash the patriarchy” it has the same energy as this card. Rather than putting energy into upholding these institutions (or passively upholding them while praying they won't affect you) why not try seeing what you can do to take them down? Your voice is a powerful weapon in helping to erode outdated ideas.",

You will certainly have to work with issues about who you can trust. But also make sure to take this opportunity to build back a life that is more in line with who you really are. You can't change what happened to you. But you can decide what is worth building next and what is better left in the rubble of the past."

Its appearance means that healing energy is available to you right now, no matter what you are going through. That may be hard for you to accept. Too many of us in the LGBTQIA+ community have been bombarded with messages of how we aren't worthy of happiness. Sadly, those messages become internalized. But now is a good time to break free of their hold on you and see how much brighter you shine without them.",

We were either too young or too isolated, so we did the best we could to bandage our wounds and carry on.",

Where are the expectations of others holding you back? Examine those expectations. Just because your parents think a home in the suburbs and a monogamous marriage is the best for them, doesn't mean it is good for you. Similarly, others insisting that bisexuals are always promiscuous doesn't mean you are less bisexual because you found happiness being with one person. Finding peace in a traditional, but fully accepting and validating, religious organization does not make you less committed to social change. Use your judgement to get to the core of your truth.",
